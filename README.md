  <h1>Bosses</h1>
</div>

## General
- Increased bonus boss health per player from +80% to +125% (maximum from +320% in Nightmare to +500%).

## Kobolds
- Slightly increased health and damage of Kobold Serfs
- Removed Kobold Warrior Disarm and replaced it with Packleader's Aura (moved from Kobold Overlord)
- Kobold Overlord now has Howl.

## Gnolls
- Slightly increased the damage of Gnoll Assassins
- Gnoll Berserkers now seek out the weakest unit in their search radius, rather than the closest unit. Gnoll Berserkers now have Berserker's Blood.

## Zombie
- Increased the rate Nethertoxin ramps and increased its maximum damage.
- Increased Zombie Lord's health.

## Slark
- Reduced the radius of Blood Rite, but reduced its cooldown.
- Bloodseeker's now has Bloodrage and casts it on the nearest ally without Bloodrage off cooldown.

## Slithereen

## Leshrac

- **Nihilism cooldown is 21**
- **Nihilism duration is 5/6/7/8**
- Prioritizes casting Split Earth on units affected by Lightning Storm.
- Increased the damage of Lightning Storm and Pulse Nova

## Harbingers
- Reduced spread damage from 16/18/20/22% to 8/9/10/11%
- The unit that dealt the damage takes twice the damage (16/18/20/22% for original damage dealer)
- Hitting a Harbinger with the correct damage category disables the cloak for that damage instance. This allows auto-attackers with mixed damage categories (Ex. Enchantress Impetus, , Monkey King Bar) to hit Shadow Fiend and allows spellcasters whose spells also apply an auto-attack (ex. Sniper Assassinate) to use their abilities without repercussions. This also allows magical attacks, which count as both attack and spell to hit either boss without consequences. Order matters, hitting Shadow Demon with Impetus will still reflect the auto-attack damage and hitting Shadow Fiend with Assassinate will reflect the initial spell damage.

## Psionic Scarab
- Reflecting Carapace now strong dispels.
- Reflecting Carapace now starts at 0% reflection and scales up to its maximum over the duration.
