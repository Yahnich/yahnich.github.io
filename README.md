## MMR
- Abandons are no longer counted towards the lobby MMR. Still applies the missing-player multiplier. Example: The MMR for winning and for losing was +40/-10 thanks to a low MMR player being in the lobby. The player abandons and the MMR change is recalculated. The new MMR change is now +30/-15 as a base, because the lobby's average MMR has increased. The game then applies a 8% MMR multiplier to both numbers, making them +32/-13

## Earth Spirit
- Boulder Smash: Using a Stone Remnant increases damage on top of increasing range.
- Boulder Smash: Creep damage multiplier from 1.25 to 2.5
- Rolling Boulder: No longer ends on hitting a creep-hero and affects all units hit, only way to stop the roll is pressing Stop or Hold.
- Rolling Boulder: Delay before rolling from 0.5 to 0.1.
- Rolling Boulder: Every Remnant destroyed by it past the first increases the damage dealt by +100%
- Rolling Boulder: Now also has a 2.5x creep damage multiplier.
- Geomagnetic Grip: Can now be cast on allies and enemies as a baseline.
- Geomagnetic Grip: Damages the enemy while pulling them. Still only Silences when using Remnants.
- Geomagnetic Grip: Using a Stone Remnant doubles the damage Stone Remnants move faster than units.
- Geomagnetic Grip: Now also has a 2.5x creep damage multiplier.
- Magnetize: Not only spreads the debuffs from Boulder Smash and Geomagnetic Grip among Magnetized units, but also the damage and forced movement effects. Rolling Boulder's effects are now included.
- Aghanim's Shard from *Geomagnetic Grip can be cast on allies* to *Earth Spirit is now affected by Magnetize like his Stone Remnants. Enemy units that come close to Earth Spirit become Magnetized. While Magnetized, Earth Spirit gains bonus spell amplification and armor. and refreshing Magnetize on himself dispels him.*
- Aghanim's Scepter from *Grants Earth Spirit the Enchant Remnant ability* to *Stone Remnants being destroyed applies a 2 second Magnetize to enemies in range. The duration stacks with, rather than refreshes, existing Magnetize debuffs*.

## Pugna
- Decrepify: Now follows the same rules as other forms of Ethereal. Disarms enemy units but not allies, turns allies immune to physical damage but not enemies.
- Life Drain: No longer an active. Is now a passive with the same cooldown. When Life Drain is off cooldown and an enemy unit is affected by one of your spells, that unit has its life drained by you. For 3 seconds, a tether forms that deals damage to the enemy unit and heals you. Life Drain can only affect one hero per application, but has no limit to creeps if they were hit by an area of effect spell. Healing from creeps is reduced by 80%. Life Drain stacks fully if reapplied.
- +20 Movement Speed talent replaced by +50% Nether Blast damage
- +50% Nether Blast damage replaced with 450 AOE Decrepify
- +40% Nether Ward Damage Per Intelligence talent replaced with +1s duration Life Drain
- Aghanim's Shard from 'Can Cast Life Drain on Ward for 75% damage to all enemies' to 'Life Drain has two charges and charge restore time reduced."
