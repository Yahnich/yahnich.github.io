## Season
- Ranks and MMR have been saved, all MMRs have been reset to 3000.

## General
- Removed base magic resistance from all heroes, melee heroes still receive 15% bonus magical resistance and intelligence still increases magic resistance.Âµ
- Reduced base mana regeneration from 10 to 5.
- Reduced all forms of gold income (round rewards, neutral camps, GPM), but also reduced item costs. 
- Endgame net worth from rounds is now 36000, equivalent to 3 T4 items and 3 T3 items or 1 T5 and 5 T2 items.

## Attribute Scaling
- Spell amplification from Intelligence removed. Instead increases base damage of spells additively, stacking with the Primary Attribute bonus.
- Increased bonus spell damage from Primary Attribute from 2% per 100 to 2.5% per 100. Universal Hero gain from 1% per 100 All Stats to 1.33%
- This means Intelligence heroes gain +4.5% increased spell damage from 100 Intelligence, Universal Heroes gain +3.33%, other Heroes gain the original +2%.
- Attack speed no longer scales diminishingly (previously was 25 attack speed for 100 agility, afterwards required 3.5x agility to double the attack speed). Heroes now gain 1 attack speed every 10 agility. Values at 100, 1000, 10000 agility from 25/67/181 to 10/100/1000
- Armor no longer scales diminishingly (previously was 0.6 armor every 10 agility, afterwards requiring 5x the agility to double the armor bonus). Heroes now gain 0.15 armor every 10 agility. Values at 100, 1000, 10000 agility from 6.5/17/47 to 1.5/15/150
- Magic resistance scaling changed from 4% magic resistance for 100 intelligence, then requiring 5x the intelligence to 2x the bonus. Instead, heroes gain 0.2% diminishing magic resistance every 10 intelligence. Each instance is treated as a seperate source of magic resistance (1 - 0.998^Intelligence/10). Still effectively provides 0.2% EHP against magic damage every 10 Intelligence. Values at 100, 1000, 10000 intelligence from 4/10.7/29% to 2/18/86.5%

## Restoration Amplification
- *2.0.0a.* Reworked entirely because Valve broke this for custom games.
-*2.0.0a.*  Removed 100% cap on Restoration Amp.
-*2.0.0a.*  Positive restoration amp and negative restoration amp add additively with restoration amplification of the same type. Negative and positive restoration amp multiply each other. Ex., 25+50% Restore Amp and -25% + -15% will add up to +75% restoration amplification and -40% Restoration Amplification. This then multiplies as 1.75 x 0.6 = 1.05 => for a total of +5% restoration amplification.
-*2.0.0a.*  More than -100% restoration amplification turns healing and restoration into health loss instead.
-*2.0.0a.*  All items that previously granted spell lifesteal, lifesteal, incoming healing or health regeneration amplification now grant Restoration Amplification.
-*2.0.0a.*  Strength now provides Restoration Amplification.
